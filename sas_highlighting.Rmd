# SAS 

To create a SAS chunk we need to add the SAS class. We also need to set `eval=FALSE` or else R will try to compile this code!


```{eval=FALSE, class='SAS'}
proc sort data=adsl;
  by descending sex;
run;
```

# R

We can use R chunks as we already know and love.

```{r, class='R'}
 3 + 5
```
